bifrost-ironic-install
======================

This role installs a standalone ironic deployment with all required substrate
in order for it to be utilized, including MySQL, dnsmasq, and nginx.

Requirements
------------

This role requires:

- Ansible 2.9

Internet access was originally a requirement but no longer is. See
doc/source/offline-install.rst for details on installing without it.

Role Variables
--------------

Testing mode is intended to help facilitate testing of the bifrost roles and
ironic by utilizing virtual machines on the localhost and the ipmi hardware
type. This variable should be set globally for playbooks utilizing the
bifrost-ironic-install role.

testing: false

Enables no-authentication mode where no authentication is used for accessing
API services. The default setting of ``true`` makes ironic
either use keystone (if ``enable_keystone`` is true) or HTTP basic auth
(use ``admin_username``/``admin_password`` and
``default_username``/``default_password`` to configure).

noauth_mode: false

Node cleaning, which was a feature added to ironic during the Kilo cycle,
removes the previous contents of a node once it has been moved from an
active to available state, such as setting the provision state to deleted.
Bifrost disables this by default in order to allow initial users to not be
impacted by node cleaning operations upfront when they are testing and
evaluating bifrost. Only metadata cleaning is enabled by default, but any
production environment should have full cleaning enabled.

cleaning: true
cleaning_disk_erase: false

The ironic python client and openstacksdk libraries can be installed directly
from Git. The default is to utilize pip to install the current versions in pypi,
however testing may require master branch or custom patches.

openstacksdk_source_install: false

Bifrost requires access to the network where nodes are located, in order to
provision the nodes. By default, this setting is set to a value for local
VM based testing, however if and when you're ready to deploy to a physical
environment, you will need to set the network_interface variable to the
attached network.

network_interface: "virbr0"

By default this role installs dnsmasq to act as a DHCP server for provisioning
hosts.  In the event this is not required, set the following configuration:

internal_ip: "<IPv4 address of network_interface>"
internal_interface: {"address": .. "network": .. "netmask": .. "broadcast": ..}

The IP address and network interface information which will be used by bare
metal machines to connect to the conductor and the internal HTTP server,
and for cross-service interactions.

dhcp_provider: "dnsmasq"

Which ironc DHCP provider to enable. When set to "none" a static dnsmasq
configuration is used, and host specific DHCP configuration can be set by
writing files to dhcp-hostsdir ``dnsmasq_dhcp_hostsdir`` and dhcp-optsdir
``dnsmasq_dhcp_optsdir``.

When set to "dnsmasq" Ironic will manage dhcp-option and dhcp-boot entries on a
per-node basis by writing files to ``dnsmasq_dhcp_hostsdir`` and
``dnsmasq_dhcp_optsdir``.

dnsmasq_dhcp_hostsdir: "/etc/dnsmasq.d/bifrost.dhcp-hosts.d"

Directory with static and ironic managed DHCP hosts configuration.

dnsmasq_dhcp_optsdir: "/etc/dnsmasq.d/bifrost.dhcp-opts.d"

Directory with ironic managed DHCP options configuration.

dnsmasq_leases_file: "/var/lib/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.leases"

File which represents dnsmasq leases, used when dhcp_provider == "dnsmasq"

enable_dhcp: false

If you chose to utilize the dhcp server, You may wish to set default ranges:

dhcp_pool_start: 192.168.1.200
dhcp_pool_end: 192.168.1.250

If you want to use bifrost as a dhcp relay target, please set ``dhcp_pool_mask``:

dhcp_pool_mask: 255.255.255.0

And also set the default dhcp address lease time:

dhcp_lease_time: 12h

Alternatively, a user can choose to perform static DHCP assignments to nodes.
This can be enabled by setting the ``inventory_dhcp`` setting to ``true``.
This will result in the ``dhcp_pool_start`` and ``dhcp_pool_end`` settings
only being used to define the range of valid ips to be accepted, and the
``ipv4_address`` setting being bound to the first listed MAC address for
the node.
If you choose to use the static DHCP assignments, you may need to set
the ``dhcp_static_mask`` setting according to your needs. It defaults to
a /24 range.
In the case of static inventory, please also consider to set the
``dhcp_lease_time`` setting to infinite, to avoid unnecessary refreshes
of ips.

If you want to force all hostnames to resolve to ``ipv4_address`` set on
the inventory, please set the ``inventory_dns`` setting to ``true``.

In case your HW needs a kernel option to boot, set the following variable:

extra_kernel_options: Default undefined.

Hardware types can be enabled using the "enabled_hardware_types" variable,
which defaults to "ipmi, ilo".

Enabled interfaces can be set via the "enabled_bios_interfaces",
"enabled_boot_interfaces", "enabled_deploy_interfaces",
"enabled_management_interfaces", and "enabled_power_interfaces" variables.
By default they are derived from "enabled_hardware_types".

In the event of an external DHCP server being used, the user will need to
configure their DHCP server such that PXE, and iPXE chain loading occurs.
For additional information for setting up DHCP in this scenario refer to
the bifrost documentation file doc/source/deploy/dhcp.rst.

Additional default variables exist in defaults/main.yml, however these are
mainly limited to settings which are unlikely to be modified, unless a user
has a custom Ironic Python Agent image, or needs to modify where the httpboot
folder is set to.

This role has several variables that can vary between OS families,
distributions, and their specific versions. These are specified in the
required_defaults_* files.  They are imported in a particular
order. For example, for Ubuntu 15.04, the role will attempt to import
the following files:

- required_defaults_Debian.yml
- required_defaults_Ubuntu.yml
- required_defaults_Ubuntu_15.04.yml

Not all of the possible files for a given distribution/version combination
need to exist. The recommended approach for adding a new variable is:

- Put the variable in the most generic set of defaults to which it applies:
  for example, if a given variable is applicable to all Debian-family
  operating systems, put it in required_defaults_Debian.yml

- Variables specified in the more specific files will be used to override
  values in the more generic defaults files.

- If a given default applies to multiple versions of a distribution, that
  variable needs to be specified for each version which it affects.

If you wish to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), such as to
connect a javascript based web client, options have been added to allow
a user to enable the integrated support.

By default, this support is disabled, but the configuration options are below:

enable_cors: Boolean value, default false, to enable CORS support.

cors_allowed_origin: A URL string that represents the origin sent by the
                     client web browser. If CORS is enabled, and this is
                     not set, it will default to http://localhost:8000/.

enable_cors_credential_support: Boolean value, default false.  This variable
                                toggles the CORS configuration to expect user
                                authentication.  Since bifrost makes use of
                                noauth mode, this realistically should not
                                be modified.

domain: String value, default to false. If set, domain setting is configured
        in dnsmasq.

remote_syslog_server: String value, default undefined. If set, rsyslog is
                      configured to send logs to this server.

remote_syslog_port: String value, default is 514. If set, custom port is
                    configured for remote syslog server.

ironic_log_dir: String value, default undefined. If set, it specifies a
                a non-default log directory for ironic.

nginx_log_dir: String value, default /var/log/nginx. It specifies a log
               directory for nginx.

fast_track: Boolean setting to enable ironic to leverage an already running
            agent on the host being deployed such that deployment can begin
            immediately as opposed to waiting for a complete system reboot.

power_off_after_inspection: Boolean setting governing the behavior
                            of inspection.
                            The default is to not power-off machines
                            effectively enabling moving from Inspection to
                            Deployment without the need to reboot
                            the physical machine.

enable_credential_less_deploy: Boolean setting that enables the experimental
                               feature of deploying nodes without BMC
                               credentials. Discovery (if enabled) will be
                               configured to use the default hardware type
                               "manual-management" and the "agent" power
                               interface will be enabled.

### Hardware Inspection Support

Bifrost also supports identification of the system properties via a workflow.

inspector_port_addition: Defines which MAC addresses to add as ports during
                         introspection. Possible values are `all`, `active`,
                         and `pxe`. The default value is `pxe`.

inspector_keep_ports: Defines which ports on a node to keep after
                      introspection. Possible values are `all`, `present`,
                      and `added`. The default value is `present`.

enable_inspector_discovery: Boolean value, default false. This instructs
                            inspector to add new nodes that are discovered
                            via PXE booting on the same network to ironic.

inspector_default_node_driver: The default driver to utilize when adding
                               discovered nodes to ironic.
                               The default value set by bifrost is
                               `ipmi`. Users should change this
                               setting for their install environment if
                               an alternative default driver is required.

inspector_extra_kernel_options: String value, default undefined. Extra
                                kernel parameters for the inspector default
                                PXE configuration.

### Virtual Environment Install

Bifrost installs ironic and other services into a python virtual environment
using the following configuration options:

bifrost_venv_dir: The full path of the virtual environment directory. The
                  default value is /opt/stack/bifrost. When VENV is set in
                  the user's environment, its contents will be used to set
                  bifrost_venv_dir.

bifrost_venv_env: An environment dictionary that includes the environment
                  variables used to run commands which require the virtual
                  environment. The default values are derived from the
                  standard 'activate' script which virtualenv installs.
                  It is best not to reset this value unless you know you
                  need to.

ssh_private_key_path: Defines the path to the SSH private key file to be
                      placed as default ssh key for ironic user. Can be useful
                      when ironic requires ssh access to another server.

ssh_private_key: If a user wishes to define an SSH private key as a string,
                 this variable can be utilized which overrides the
                 ssh_private_key_path setting.

### Ironic Python Agent

ipa_download_headers: HTTP headers to use when downloading IPA.

### Changing Database Configuration

Bifrost utilizes a nested data structure for the configuration of database.
Simply put:

  - Values cannot be overridden via set_fact.
  - Values cannot be overridden via the command line with ``-e``.
  - The entire data structure must be defined if is modified.

Please see defaults/main.yml file for the structure named ``ironic``.

Please note, if the hostname is set to something besides``localhost``,
then the playbook will not attempt to create databases, database users,
and grant privileges.

Notes
-----

This role, by default, deploys an alternative boot.ipxe file to the one
that ironic deploys, and configures ironic to use this alternative file.
This is because not every boot case can be covered. If you encounter a
case where you find that you need to modify the file, please notify us
by filing a bug in launchpad.

Bifrost's launchpad project is located at:
