bifrost-create-vm-nodes
=======================

This role creates virtual machines for testing bifrost.

Requirements
------------

The following packages are required and ensured to be present:
- libvirt-bin
- qemu-utils
- qemu-kvm
- sgabios (except on CentOS Stream 10 / Rocky Linux 10)


Warning
-------

For backward compatibility some variables listed below may default to values
of corresponding shell variables on the management host (where
ansible-playbook is launched) as described.
This behavior is deprecated and will be removed in the Queens release.
Non-default values for these variables should be passed to ansible-playbook
as extra-vars instead.

Role Variables
--------------

baremetal_json_file: Bare metal inventory file. Defaults to
                     '/tmp/baremetal.json'.

test_vm_memory_size: Tunable setting to allow a user to define a specific
                     amount of RAM in MB to allocate to guest/test VMs.
                     Defaults to "3072". Note: if this setting is modified
                     between test runs, you may need to undefine the test
                     virtual machine(s) that were previously created.

test_vm_domain_type: Tunable setting to allow a user to chosee the domain
                     type of the created VMs. The default is "qemu" and can
                     be set to kvm to enable kvm acceleration.

test_vm_num_nodes: Tunable setting to allow a user to define the number of
                   test VMs that will be created. They will all be created
                   with same settings.

test_vm_arch: Defines the architecture of VM to create.
              Defaults to "x86_64".
              The value of this variable is passed directly to libvirt
              when creating VMs.
              Generally users should not need to modify this setting.
              Any other than default value is untested.

test_vm_disk_gib: Disk size for VMs to be created, in GiB.
                  Defaults to shell variable 'VM_DISK' or,
                  if that is not set, to 10.

test_vm_cpu_count: Number of CPUs to create the VMs with.
                   Defaults to shell variable 'VM_CPU', or,
                   if that is not set, to 1.

test_vm_disk_cache: Disk cache mode to use by VMs disk.
                    Defaults to shell variable 'VM_DISK_CACHE', or,
                    if that is not set, to 'writeback'.

test_vm_node_names: Space-separated names for nodes to be created.
                    Defaults to shell variable 'TEST_VM_NODE_NAMES'.
                    If not set, VM names will be autogenerated.
                    Note that independent on the number of names in this list,
                    at most 'test_vm_num_nodes' VMs will be created.

test_vm_node_name_base: Base name to generate VM names when names
                        are not explicitly set.
                        Defaults to shell variable 'NODEBASE', or,
                        if that is not set, to 'testvm'.

test_vm_network: Name of the libvirt network to create the nodes on.
                 Defaults to shell variable 'VM_NET_BRIDGE', or,
                 if that is not set, to 'default'.

test_vm_storage_pool: Name of the libvirt storage pool to create disks
                      for VMs in.
                      Defaults to shell variable 'LIBVIRT_STORAGE_POOL', or,
                      if that is not set, to 'default'.
                      If absent, this pool will be created.

test_vm_storage_pool_path: Path used by the libvirt storage pool
                           'test_vm_storage_pool' if it has to be created.
                           Defaults to "/var/lib/libvirt/images".

test_vm_logdir: Folder where to store VM logs.
                Defaults to "/var/log/libvirt/baremetal_logs".

test_vm_emulator: Path to emulator executable used to define VMs in libvirt.
                  Defaults to "/usr/bin/qemu-system-x86_64".
                  Generally users should not need to modify this setting,
                  as it is OS-specific and is overwritten by
                  os/distribution-specific defaults in this role when needed.

test_vm_machine: Type of the VM to define in libvirt.
                 Defaults to "pc-1.0".
                 Generally users should not need to modify this setting,
                 as it is OS-specific and is overwritten by
                 os/distribution-specific defaults in this role when needed.

test_vm_libvirt_uri: URI to connect to libvirt for networks, storage and VM
                     related actions.
                     Defaults to shell variable 'LIBVIRT_CONNECT_URI', or,
                     if that is not set, to 'qemu:///system'.
                     Note that currently connecting to remote libvirt is
                     not tested and is unsupported.

test_vm_network: Name of the libvirt network to create for VMs.
                 Defaults to shell variable 'VM_NET_BRIDGE', or, if that is
                 not set, to 'default'.
                 The network is created only if it does not already exist.

network_interface: Name of the bridge to create when creating
                   'test_vm_network' libvirt network.
                   Defaults to "virbr0".
                   Name and default of this option are chosen to be the same
                   as in 'bifrost-ironic-install' role.

test_vm_network_ip: IP for the 'network_interface' bridge.
                    Defaults to '192.168.122.1'.
                    This setting is applied only when 'test_vm_network'

                         Defaults to '255.255.255.0'.
                         This setting is applied only when 'test_vm_network'
                         was absent and is created from scratch.

test_vm_network_enable_dhcp: Whether to enable DHCP on 'test_vm_network'.
                             Defaults to 'true'.
                             This setting is applied only when
                             'test_vm_network' was absent and is created
                             from scratch.

                            Defaults to '192.168.122.2'.
