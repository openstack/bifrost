# This is an example playbook utilizing role conditionals to permit
# deployment on available nodes.
#
# To utilize:
# export BIFROST_INVENTORY_SOURCE=ironic
# ansible-playbook -vvvv -i inventory/bifrost_inventory.py example-deploy-all-available-nodes.yaml
#
# NOTE(TheJulia): The format of this example will cause hosts to be deployed
# utilizing DHCP on eth0 of Ubuntu/Debian hosts. It is advisable you build
# your deployment image with the dhcp-all-interfaces element when deploying
# other operating systems or if your target node has multiple ethernet
# interfaces.
#
# NOTE(TheJulia): A user could utilize the os_ironic_node_info module with
# another data source such as a YAML or JSON file formats to query ironic,
# and the example role conditionals below to query current status and
# deploy to nodes.
