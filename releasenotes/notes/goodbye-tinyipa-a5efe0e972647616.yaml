    Using tinyipa as ironic-python-agent ramdisk is not supported anymore.
    Bifrost has switched to using DIB (diskimage-builder) based IPA ramdisks
    for all CI jobs.
    All Bifrost CI jobs now use ``dibipa`` (DIB-based IPA) in their names
    to clearly indicate they use full-featured IPA ramdisks built with
    diskimage-builder.
    Test VM memory has been increased from 1024 MB to 4096 MB to accommodate
    the larger DIB-based IPA ramdisks (~500 MB vs ~80 MB for tinyipa).
    Three legacy job names with ``tinyipa`` in their names are kept for
    backward compatibility with other OpenStack projects (Ironic,
    openstacksdk, ansible-collections-openstack). These jobs now use
    DIB-based IPA despite their names. Projects using these legacy job
    names should migrate to the new ``dibipa`` job names when ready.
