    Adds support for using Open vSwitch (OVS) as a virtual switch for testing
    environments. Setting ``test_vm_switch_type`` to ``ovs`` creates 3 separate
    VLANs for comprehensive network testing: one dedicated as an inspection
    network, another for the final tenant network, and a third for all other
    network types (cleaning, rescuing, servicing, etc.). This enhancement
    enables testing of the standalone networking feature with proper VLAN
    configuration support through the networking generic switch driver.
