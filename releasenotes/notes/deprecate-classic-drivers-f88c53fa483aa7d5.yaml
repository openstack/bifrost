features:
  - |
    The ``enabled_hardware_types`` variable has been introduced to support
    use of hardware types.
    The ``default_deploy_interface`` variable has been introduced to support
    setting a default method of deployment for new nodes. It defaults to the
    ``direct`` deployment interface.
deprecations:
  - |
    Ironic has deprecated support for classic drivers. These were the drivers
    that were prepended with ``agent`` or ``pxe``. The new default hardware type,
    which supersedes drivers, is ``ipmi``. The default deployment interface is
    ``direct``, which supersedes the ``agent`` driver type. Support for classic
    Drivers, will be removed from Bifrost in the Rocky release cycle.
issues:
  - |
    Support for hardware types is in the beginning stages in Bifrost. Presently
    the ``os_ironic`` ansible module does not yet understand hardware types.
