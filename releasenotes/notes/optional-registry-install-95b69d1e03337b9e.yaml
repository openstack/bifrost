    The OCI image registry installation can now be disabled using the
    ``enable_registry`` variable or the ``--disable-registry`` CLI flag.
    The registry remains enabled by default to maintain backward
    compatibility.

    To disable during installation:

    * CLI: ``bifrost-cli install --disable-registry``
    * Ansible: ``-e enable_registry=false``
