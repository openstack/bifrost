deprecations:
  - |
    Since support for the ironic-inspector service is deprecated in Ironic,
    it is also deprecated in Bifrost, together with the ``enable_inspector``
    variable. They will be removed in the 2026.1 release cycle.

    Bifrost users that set ``enable_inspector`` to ``true`` should check
    the `ironic-inspector migration guide
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/admin/inspection/migration.html>`_
    for information on how to migrate to the native in-band inspection
    in Ironic.
