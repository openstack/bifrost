    Fixes an issue where ``inspection_callback_url`` was templated with leading
    whitespace. This caused the ``ipa-inspection-callback-url`` kernel command
    line argument to be incorrectly set, leading to Ironic Python Agent posting
    introspection data back to Ironic rather than Ironic Inspector when using
    the ``enable_inspector`` option.
