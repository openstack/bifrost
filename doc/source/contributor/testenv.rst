Testing Environment
===================

Quick start with bifrost-cli
============================

If you want to try Bifrost on virtual machines instead of real hardware, you
need to prepare a testing environment. The easiest way is via ``bifrost-cli``,
available since the Victoria release series:

.. code-block:: bash

   ./bifrost-cli testenv

Additionally, the following parameters can be useful:

``--driver=[ipmi|redfish]``
    Choose the default driver for the generated nodes inventory.

    .. note::
       Both IPMI and Redfish support is configured anyway, so you can switch
       the drivers on fly if needed.

       IPMI support uses VirtualBMC_, Redfish - sushy-tools_.

``--uefi``
    Makes the testing VMs boot with UEFI.

See the built-in documentation for more details:

    .. note::
       You still need to restart services to apply any changes, e.g.::

        sudo systemctl restart ironic

.. code-block:: bash

    ./bifrost-cli testenv --help

The command generates two files with node inventory in the current directory:

* ``baremetal-inventory.json`` can be used with the provided playbooks, see
  :doc:`/user/howto` for details.
* ``baremetal-nodes.json`` can be used with the Ironic enrollment command:

  .. code-block:: shell

    export OS_CLOUD=bifrost
    baremetal create baremetal-nodes.json

Reproduce CI testing locally
============================

A simple ``scripts/test-bifrost.sh`` script can be utilized to install
pre-requisite software packages, Ansible, and then execute the
``test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` and ``test-bifrost.yaml`` playbooks in order
to provide a single step testing mechanism.

``playbooks/test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` creates one or more VMs for
testing and saves out a baremetal.json file which is used by
``playbooks/test-bifrost.yaml`` to execute the remaining roles.  Two
additional roles are invoked by this playbook which enables Ansible to
connect to the new nodes by adding them to the inventory, and then
logging into the remote machine via the user's ssh host key.  Once
that has successfully occurred, additional roles will unprovision the
host(s) and delete them from ironic.

Command::

  scripts/test-bifrost.sh

Note:

- In order to cap requirements for installation, an ``upper_constraints_file``
  setting is defined. This is consuming the ``UPPER_CONSTRAINTS_FILE`` or
  ``TOX_CONSTRAINTS_FILE`` env var by default, to properly integrate with CI
  systems, and will default to
  ``/opt/stack/requirements/upper-constraints.txt`` file if not present.

Manually test with Virtual Machines
===================================

Bifrost supports using virtual machines to emulate the hardware.

The VirtualBMC_ project is used as an IPMI proxy, so that the same ``ipmi``
hardware type can be used as for real hardware. Redfish emulator from
sushy-tools_ is also installed.

#. Set ``testing`` to *true* in the
   ``playbooks/inventory/group_vars/target`` file.
#. You may need to adjust the value for ``ssh_public_key_path``.
#. Execute the ``ansible-playbook -vvvv -i inventory/target
   test-bifrost-create-vm.yaml`` command to create a test virtual
   machine.
#. Run the install step, as documented in :doc:`/install/index`, however
   adding ``-e testing=true`` to the Ansible command line.
#. Set the environment variable of ``BIFROST_INVENTORY_SOURCE`` to the
   path to the JSON file, which by default has been written to
   ``/tmp/baremetal.json``.
#. Run the :ref:`enrollment step <enroll>`, using the JSON file you created
   in the previous step.
#. Run the deployment step, as documented in :ref:`deploy`.
