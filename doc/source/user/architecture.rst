Bifrost Architecture
====================

This document describes what and how Bifrost installs in the default setup
(e.g. one created by ``./bifrost-cli install``).

Components
----------

Bifrost installs the following main components:

ironic_
    Ironic is the main service that provides bare metal capabilities.
    Its `bare metal API`_ is served on TCP port 6385.

mariadb_
    MariaDB is used as a database to persistently store information.

nginx_
    Nginx is used as a web server for three main purposes:

    * to serve iPXE configuration scripts when booting nodes over the network,
    * to serve virtual media ISO images to BMC when booting nodes over virtual
      CD,
    * to serve instance images to the ramdisk when deploying nodes.

    Uses HTTP port 8080 by default (can be changed via the ``file_url_port``
    parameter).

    When TLS is enabled, Nginx serves as a TLS proxy for Ironic. It listens on
    port 6385 and passes requests to the service via a unix socket.

dnsmasq_
    Dnsmasq is used as a DHCP and TFTP server (but not for DNS by default)
    when booting nodes over the network. It can also be used to provide DHCP
    to deployed nodes.

    Dnsmasq can be disabled by setting ``enable_dhcp=false``
    or passing ``--disable-dhcp`` to ``bifrost-cli``.

The following components can be enabled if needed:

keystone_
    Keystone is an OpenStack Identity service. It can be used to provide
    sophisticated authentication to Ironic instead of HTTP basic
    authentication. Its `identity API`_ is served using uWSGI and Nginx on the
    port 5000, the systemd service is called ``uwsgi@keystone-public``.

    See :doc:`/user/keystone` for details.

ironic-prometheus-exporter_
    An exporter that exposes hardware metrics from the node's BMC (using IPMI
    or Redfish) for consumption by Prometheus_.

    The exporter can be enabled by setting ``enable_prometheus_exporter=true``
    or passing ``--enable-prometheus-exporter`` to ``bifrost-cli``.

Networking
----------

:doc:`/install/index` requires to specify the network interface which will be
used for communication with the nodes. On systems that use firewalld_, a new
zone ``bifrost`` is created with this interface, and firewall settings are
adjusted to allow boot traffic (DHCP, TFTP, etc) through this interface.

Virtual testing environments use network interface ``virbr0``, IP subnet
``192.168.122.1/24`` and the ``libvirt`` firewalld zone by default.

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~

``network_interface``
    the main network interface for provisioning nodes. It is recommended to use
    an isolated network for this purpose.

``internal_ip``
    IPv4 address of the Bifrost node on the provisioning interface. Normally
    derived automatically. You can use the following command to detect it:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo awk '/^tftp_server =/ { print $3 }' /etc/ironic/ironic.conf
        192.168.122.1

    This IP address is used for all provisioning traffic: TFTP, iPXE,
    and call-backs to Ironic. It is also used for the traffic between
    the services.

``public_ip``
    IPv4 address of the Bifrost node that is accessible outside of the
    provisioning environment. Used e.g. to provide public URLs for the service
    catalog, when Keystone support is enabled.

.. note::
   Bifrost does not currently support IPv6, contributions are welcome.

Locations
---------

.. note::
   Many locations are not writable or even readable by the regular user (even
   the one that started installation). You need to use ``sudo`` or add the user
   to ``ironic`` and ``nginx`` groups.

Installation locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``/opt/stack/bifrost``
    is a Python virtual environment where all Python packages are installed.

``/opt/stack/<reponame>``
    is a source directory for project ``<reponame>`` (e.g. ``ironic``)
    installed from source. Services are installed this way, while libraries are
    mostly installed as packages.

    Unlike most other locations, these paths will be owned by the user
    that installed Bifrost (i.e. your regular user).

Log locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

journald
    is used for logging from most services. For example, to get Ironic logs:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo journalctl -u ironic

``/var/log/ironic/deploy``
    contains tarballs with ramdisk logs from deployment or cleaning. The file
    name format is ``<node UUID>-<node name>-[cleaning-]<datatime>.tar.gz``.
    You can access the main logs like this:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ cd $(mktemp -d)
        $ sudo tar -xzf \
            /var/log/ironic/deploy/493aacf2-90ec-5e3d-9ce5-ea496f12e2a5_testvm3_2021-11-08-17-34-18.tar.gz
        $ less journal  # for ramdisks that use systemd, e.g. DIB-built
        $ less var/log/ironic-python-agent.log # for tinyIPA and similar

``/var/log/nginx/``
    contains logs for serving files (iPXE scripts, images, virtual media ISOs).

``/var/log/nginx/keystone``
    contains HTTP logs for Keystone API, complementing the logs from the
    ``uwsgi@keystone-public`` systemd unit.

Runtime locations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``/var/lib/ironic/httpboot``
    HTTP root directory. Contains iPXE scripts and images, including
    ``deployment_image.qcow2`` which is built or downloaded during Bifrost
    installation.

    You can detect the root URL with the following command:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo awk '/^http_url =/ { print $3 }' /etc/ironic/ironic.conf
        http://192.168.122.1:8080/

``/var/lib/tftpboot``
    TFTP root directory. Normally contains only the binaries to run iPXE on
    systems that don't have an iPXE firmware built in. Can contain images when
    the ``pxe`` boot interface is used.

``/var/lib/ironic/master_images``
    cache for instance images.

``/var/lib/ironic/master_iso_images``
    cache for virtual media ISO images.

``/var/lib/ironic/certificates``
    TLS certificates that are used to communicate to the ramdisk on the nodes
    when cleaning or deploying.

``/run/ironic``
    When TLS is enabled, this directory contains the unix socket of Ironic,
    that Nginx uses to pass requests.
